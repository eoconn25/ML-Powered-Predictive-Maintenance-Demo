# ML Powered Predictive Maintenance
This was an Honors (extracurricular) project for the Industrial Engineering course IEM 4103: Quality Control and Reliability Analysis at Oklahoma State University. In this study, I apply Machine Learning techniques to predict machine failure on a publicly available dataset. The project report can be viewed in the PDF linked below, and project code is available in this repository.
